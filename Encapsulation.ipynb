    "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data, and the methods to work as a single unit.\n",
    "- Now by doing this, it put restrictions to access variables and methods directly and also can save us from the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "- To prevent this change, we can only change an object’s variable by the object’s method. These types of variables are called private variables.\n",

    "## A real-life example of encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us see an example of real life. Suppose there is a company that consists of many sections like finance section, sales section, accounts section, etc. All sections have their role to play. The finance section handles the finance work of the company and the sales section maintains the sales works of the company. Someday the finance section needs the records of the sales section. Now the finance section can not directly just access the records of the sales section. So in that case, the finance section will ask one o the agents from the sales section to let them access some records that were needed by the finance section. Now, this is what encapsulation i. Here the sales records and the agents working in that section are wrapped in a single unit named as sales section. Also using encapsulation, we can hide data, as in the above example we can see that the employees of the finance section can not access the records or the sales section. So in this section data of a section is hidden from other sections."
